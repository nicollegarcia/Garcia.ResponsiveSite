                <h2>Florida Track & Field State Finals</h2>
                All our hard work this season has been leading to this one moment-- this one race. Will we come in top 8 to medal? Or, will we win first place? We aren't projected to win, but maybe we can beat the odds! Pictured to the right is myself battling it out head to head for second place. The first place team was already too far ahead.

                <h2>4x800m Relay: Runner-Up</h2>
                Although not everyone on the team had a great race that day, most of us ran a personal record and beat all of our old times. No, we didn't win state title, but I will always be proud of my girls for running their hearts out and getting this far. After so many injuries, blood, sweat, and tears shed this season, we did it. Number two in the state ins't too shabby!
