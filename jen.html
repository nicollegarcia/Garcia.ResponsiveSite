                <h2>About the Conference</h2>
                The Jazz Education Conference brings together jazz beginners and experts for a once-in-a lifetime experience. It is part music festival, part networking, part education and all inspiration. The annual conference hosts thousands of people from around the globe. The primary reason I was in New Orleans was to attend the JEN Conference along with many of my peers at the University of Miami’s esteemed Frost School of Music.  I was fortunate enough to meet and learn from many of my musical heroes.

                <h2>Conference Performances</h2>
                Throughout the four days of the JEN conference there are nonstop concerts.  A full spectrum of artists perform: middle school ensembles ranging all the way to multi-Grammy Award-winning musicians.  Pictured here is one of the evening-ending concerts from the JEN conference.  On stage are masterful electric bassists Steve Bailey and Victor Wooten, Jeff Coffin of the Dave Matthews Band, harmonica virtuoso Howard Levy, and drummer and percussionist Roy “Future-Man” Wooten.  Between them they hold 16 Grammy Awards.
