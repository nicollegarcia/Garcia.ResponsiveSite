              <h2>Off to the Races</h2>
              Before every race, the girl's 4x800m relay team lines up to get their bib number and stickers after warming up. We then stay on the inside of the track waiting for our heat, or running group, to be called to the starting line. Here on the grass, we change our shoes from trainers to spikes. This is probably the most nerve-racking part of the whole meet.

              <h2>District Champions</h2>
              In the photo to the right, Lauren hands me the baton after completing her section of the race which is 800m (two laps around the track). Now, it's my job to maintain the lead she gained for us. Being the third leg or third runner of the relay means you have to make sure you maintain the lead to give the last runner, or closer, enough room to complete the race in first place. We all had a great race and it was no suprise that our relay team finished in first place to advance automatically to the Florida Track & Field State Finals Championship.
