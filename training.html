        <h2>Those Who Suffer Together, Stay Together</h2>
        No doubt, running is a highly demanding sport physically and mentally. The secret to getting through it all? Pack running. Study finds that elite competitors who ran in packs slowed less throughout their training, workouts, and races. If you choose the right group, and your pacers deliver the correct pace, pace groups can be highly effective. Pack running, or running together in a group with a consistent pace, helps you mentally push your body to its highest potential. We are more likely to train successfully in the proper training group, than alone. It may feel daunting to show up to practice knowing you have a 10 mile workout ahead of you, but if your bestfriend is right by your side, suffering through the pain, too, it makes all the difference-- trust me!

        <h2>Strength Training, Strides, and Handoffs</h2>
        Strength training, strides, and handoffs are just as important as the running portion of daily practice. Strength training is an essential supplement to a runnerâ€™s roadwork because it strengthens muscles and joints, which can improve race times and decrease injury risk. A stride, also known as a pick-up or a strider, is an easy-to-perform running drill that improves your form and mechanics. The ultimate goal of running strides is to increase your stride length while maintaining a quick turnover, or cadence. Pictured to the right is the girl's 4x800m relay team having fun after practicing and perfecting their the handoffs with the batons.

        <h2>We Have Each Other's Backs-- Literally</h2>
       After practice it is not uncommon for us to help each other: bring each other ice for painful injuries, massage each other's legs or cramps. Or, as shown to the right, a group of us forming a massage train to give a plain old back massage. We truly care about each other. Playing a sport in order to spend time with old friends, or to make new friends, is one of the most common motives for participating in sports for all children, teens, and even adults. One of the greatest feelings in sports is getting to hang out with friends, share the experience of working hard and competing together against others.
